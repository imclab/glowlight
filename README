16 x (http://macetech.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1&products_id=1 "ShiftBrite LED")

1 x laptop with a webcam

Software
========

1. Build GlowLightArduino sketch and upload to Arduino board
2. Download and install (http://libcinder.org "Cinder")
3. You'll need Visual Studio 2010 to build GlowLightCinder project as-is, with some adjustment for Cinder paths. Code should be able to be built on any platform supported by Cinder, I plan on adding Xcode project when have a chance.
